====================

COMP 20 Fall 2014 Private Repo for Mathurshan Vimalesvaran


What is this purpose of this Git repository?
  - To showcase my knowledge of web development and prove to Ming that I learned things
What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
  - A2 - Mmap
  - I loved actually creating something I could see working. 
    I am not a huge fan of database development because there is less confirmation of my work.
    In mmap, I was able to request data, work with data, and display data in a cool way. It is 
    more creative for me.
How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
  - I definitely believe I am more confident in my skills. I confirmed my confidence at the Hackathon
      where I was able to apply my knowledge of web development and actually create a site. I think
      the semester project is another good way for me to illustrate and apply my skills.
What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
  - Servers and Content - putting it all together
    - Sending data to websites and being able to play with it in A2
    - Creating a server with content for people to reach in A3 and the semester project.
    - I believe it is fairly easy to understand how to write html and css, but it's difficult
        to put it all together. Creating a web application with a legitmate server is doing just that.
Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
  - Security and UI (Both just for fun)
